##  实验室信息 Lab Dase-314 

I run a small lab studying database and distributed systems. Our research area includes: storage, in-memory and parallel computing,  transaction processing and distributed consensus. In the lab, we prefer study open-sourced systems or open-sourced projects. The students are engaged in research/engineering in systems.

Specifically, my recent interests include:

* Distributed transaction and distributed consensus theory
* Distributed system under new environment, including large-scale 
  distributed database, cloud-based database, database system under hierarchical storage(DRAM/PM/SSD/S3), database for new hardware
* Database system for specific domains, include database for AI,  time series database, etc
